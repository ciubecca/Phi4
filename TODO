I profiled the Vhh matrix generation for L=10, ET=15, EL=30 and #tails=200
The report can be read with
python -m line_profiler genMatrix.py.lprof

Possibilities for speed optimization
1) gendlist() with the n-sum algorithm. Also generalize the algorithm such that the sum of 
the momenta is less than nmax
2) bringing part of the code inside computeMatrixElement to C?
3) Parallelize the matrix generation (this should be easy, which just need to split the 
basis in chunks)
4) Save the to Vhh matrix to disk using pyTables and extract it in blocks when computing matrix products. Ideally then it'll be computed only once
